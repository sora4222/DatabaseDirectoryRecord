# Database Directory Record
This project aims to create a database that will record all the files I have, and where they are located
including which computer they are on.

Doing this will be eventually partnered with another project to create a GUI that will list all the
files I have on each of my computers and allow for transfers and quick search capabilities.

The current database type that I will be using is a Postgres but I aim to make this easily configurable
in the future.
